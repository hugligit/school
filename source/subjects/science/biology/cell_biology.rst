Students should be able to explain how the main sub-cellular structures,
including the nucleus, cell membranes, mitochondria, chloroplasts in
plant cells and plasmids in bacterial cells are related to their
functions.


Students should be able to use estimations and explain when they
should be used to judge the relative size or area of sub-cellular
structures.

Required practical activity 1: use a light microscope to observe, draw and
label a selection of plant
and animal cells. A magnification scale must be included.

Cell specialisation
===================

Students should be able to, when provided with appropriate information,
explain how the structure of different types of cell relate to their
function in a tissue, an organ or organ system, or the whole organism.

Cells may be specialised to carry out a particular function:

* sperm cells, nerve cells and muscle cells in animals
* root hair cells, xylem and phloem cells in plants.

Cell differentiation
====================

Students should be able to explain the importance of cell differentiation.
As an organism develops, cells differentiate to form different types of
cells.

* Most types of animal cell differentiate at an early stage.
* Many types of plant cells retain the ability to differentiate throughout life.

In mature animals, cell division is mainly restricted to repair and
replacement. As a cell differentiates it acquires different sub-cellular
structures to enable it to carry out a certain function. It has become a
specialised cell.

Microscope
==========

Students should be able to:
* understand how microscopy techniques have developed over time
* explain how electron microscopy has increased understanding of
sub-cellular structures.
Limited to the differences in magnification and resolution.
An electron microscope has much higher magnification and resolving
power than a light microscope. This means that it can be used to
study cells in much finer detail. This has enabled biologists to see and
understand many more sub-cellular structures.

Students should be able to carry out calculations involving
magnification, real size and image size using the formula:

.. card::
   :width: 100%
   :shadow: sm
   :text-align: center

   :math:`magnigfication = \Large\frac{size\ of\ image}{size\ of\ real\ image}`


magnifcation =
size of image
size of real object
Students should be able to express answers in standard form if
appropriate.

Culturing microorganisms
========================

.. index:: nutrient

Bacteria multiply by simple cell division (binary fission) as often as
once every 20 minutes if they have enough nutrients and a suitable
temperature.
Bacteria can be grown in a nutrient broth solution or as colonies on an
agar gel plate.
Uncontaminated cultures of microorganisms are required for
investigating the action of disinfectants and antibiotics.

Students should be able to describe how to prepare an uncontaminated
culture using aseptic technique.
They should be able to explain why:

* Petri dishes and culture media must be sterilised before use
* inoculating loops used to transfer microorganisms to the media must be
  sterilised by passing them through a flame
* the lid of the Petri dish should be secured with adhesive tape and
  stored upside down
* in school laboratories, cultures should generally be incubated at 25°C.

Students should be able to calculate cross-sectional areas of colonies or
clear areas around colonies using πr².

Students should be able to calculate the number of bacteria in a
population after a certain time if given the mean division time.

Required practical activity 2: investigate the effect of antiseptics or
antibiotics on bacterial growth
using agar plates and measuring zones of inhibition.

Cell division
*************

Chromosomes
===========

The nucleus of a cell contains chromosomes made of DNA molecules.
Each chromosome carries a large number of genes.
In body cells the chromosomes are normally found in pairs.

Mitosis and the cell cycle
==========================

Cells divide in a series of stages called the cell cycle. Students should
be able to describe the stages of the cell cycle, including mitosis.

During the cell cycle the genetic material is doubled and then divided
into two identical cells.

Before a cell can divide it needs to grow and increase the number of
sub-cellular structures such as ribosomes and mitochondria. The DNA
replicates to form two copies of each chromosome.

In mitosis one set of chromosomes is pulled to each end of the cell and
the nucleus divides.

Finally the cytoplasm and cell membranes divide to form two identical
cells.

Students need to understand the three overall stages of the cell cycle
but do not need to know the different phases of the mitosis stage.

Cell division by mitosis is important in the growth and development of
multicellular organisms.

Students should be able to recognise and describe situations in given
contexts where mitosis is occurring.

Stem cells
==========

A stem cell is an undifferentiated cell of an organism which is capable of
giving rise to many more cells of the same type, and from which certain
other cells can arise from differentiation.

Students should be able to describe the function of stem cells in
embryos, in adult animals and in the meristems in plants.

Stem cells from human embryos can be cloned and made to
differentiate into most different types of human cells.

Stem cells from adult bone marrow can form many types of cells
including blood cells.

Meristem tissue in plants can differentiate into any type of plant cell,
throughout the life of the plant.

Knowledge and understanding of stem cell techniques are not required.

Treatment with stem cells may be able to help conditions such as
diabetes and paralysis.

In therapeutic cloning an embryo is produced with the same genes as
the patient. Stem cells from the embryo are not rejected by the patient’s
body so they may be used for medical treatment.

The use of stem cells has potential risks such as transfer of viral
infection, and some people have ethical or religious objections.

Stem cells from meristems in plants can be used to produce clones of
plants quickly and economically.

* Rare species can be cloned to protect from extinction.
* Crop plants with special features such as disease resistance can be
  cloned to produce large numbers of identical plants for farmers.

Transport in cells
******************

Diffusions
==========

Substances may move into and out of cells across the cell membranes via
diffusion.

Diffusion is the spreading out of the particles of any substance in
solution, or particles of a gas, resulting in a net movement from an area
of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.

Some of the substances transported in and out of cells by diffusion are
oxygen and carbon dioxide in gas exchange, and of the waste product urea
from cells into the blood plasma for excretion in the kidney.

Students should be able to explain how different factors affect the rate
of diffusion.

Factors which affect the rate of diffusion are:

* the difference in concentrations (concentration gradient)
* the temperature
* the surface area of the membrane.

A single-celled organism has a relatively large surface area to volume
ratio. This allows sufficient transport of molecules into and out of the
cell to meet the needs of the organism.

Students should be able to calculate and compare surface area to volume
ratios.

Students should be able to explain the need for exchange surfaces and
a transport system in multicellular organisms in terms of surface area to
volume ratio.

Students should be able to explain how the small intestine and lungs in
mammals, gills in fish, and the roots and leaves in plants, are adapted
for exchanging materials.

In multicellular organisms, surfaces and organ systems are specialised for
exchanging materials. This is to allow sufficient molecules to be
transported into and out of cells for the organism’s needs. The
effectiveness of an exchange surface is increased by:

* having a large surface area
* a membrane that is thin, to provide a short diffusion path
* (in animals) having an efficient blood supply
* (in animals, for gaseous exchange) being ventilated.

Osmosis
=======

Water may move across cell membranes via osmosis. Osmosis is the
diffusion of water from a dilute solution to a concentrated solution
through a partially permeable membrane.

Students should be able to:

* use simple compound measures of rate of water uptake
* use percentages
* calculate percentage gain and loss of mass of plant tissue.

Students should be able to plot, draw and interpret appropriate graphs.

Required practical activity 3: investigate the effect of a range of
concentrations of salt or sugar solutions on the mass of plant tissue.

Active transport
================

Active transport moves substances from a more dilute solution to a more
concentrated solution (against a concentration gradient). This requires
energy from respiration.

Active transport allows mineral ions to be absorbed into plant root hairs
from very dilute solutions in the soil. Plants require ions for healthy
growth.

It also allows sugar molecules to be absorbed from lower concentrations
in the gut into the blood which has a higher sugar concentration. Sugar
molecules are used for cell respiration.

Students should be able to:

* describe how substances are transported into and out of cells by
  diffusion, osmosis and active transport
* explain the differences between the three processes.
